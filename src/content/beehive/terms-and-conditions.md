# Terms & Conditions

**Last updated:** June 23, 2025

Welcome to Beehive, a mobile game developed and operated by Chunky Tofu Studio LLC ("Chunky Tofu," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of Beehive ("the Beehive") and related services worldwide. By accessing or using the Beehive, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Beehive.

## Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Beehive. If you are under 18, you may only use the Beehive under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms.

## License

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Beehive for personal, non-commercial purposes. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

## User Accounts

Some features of the Beehive require you to create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current information and keep it updated. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and all activities under it.

## Virtual Items and Purchases

The Beehive may offer virtual items such as hints, swaps, or other in-Beehive content ("Virtual Items"). Virtual Items have no real-world monetary value and cannot be redeemed for cash, transferred outside the Beehive, or traded with other users. All purchases of Virtual Items are final and non-refundable except where required by applicable law. We may change, limit, or discontinue Virtual Items at any time without liability.

## Fees and Payment

You may be required to purchase a subscription to access some of the artwork and other premium features of the app. The cost of the subscription and any applicable sales tax will be charged to your App Store / Google Play account. Beehive offers a 7-day free trial. Unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your trial or subscription period, you will be charged recurringly either weekly, monthly, or yearly, depending on the subscription plan you have chosen.

You agree to pay all charges or fees at the prices then in effect for your purchases, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment provider for any such amounts upon making your purchase. If your purchase is subject to recurring charges, you consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until you notify us of your cancellation.

All purchases of Virtual Items and subscriptions are final and non-refundable except where required by law.

## Subscription Cancellation

You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime in App Store / Google Play settings. The cancellation will take effect at the end of your current subscription period. You will not receive a refund for the current subscription period if you do not cancel 24 hours before the period begins. Learn how to cancel for [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) or [Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481).

If you need help canceling your subscription, please email us at <chunkytofustudios@gmail.com>.

## Social Features

The Beehive may include social features that allow you to add friends, share results, or interact with other users. By using these features, you agree:

* To treat other users respectfully and not post harmful or offensive content.
* That your username, Beehive activity, and profile details may be visible to others.
* To comply with applicable laws regarding online communication.

We reserve the right to remove content or suspend accounts for violations of these Terms or for behavior that creates an unsafe environment.

## User Conduct

You agree not to:

* Violate any applicable laws or regulations.
* Use the Beehive for unlawful, fraudulent, or harmful purposes.
* Interfere with the Beehive’s operation, servers, or networks.
* Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Beehive.

We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms.

## Intellectual Property

All content in the Beehive—including graphics, text, music, designs, and software—is owned by Chunky Tofu or its licensors and protected by intellectual property laws. You may not use our content except as permitted by these Terms. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Chunky Tofu Studios.

## Third-Party Services

The app uses third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions. Links to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:

* [AdMob](https://developers.google.com/admob/terms)

## Disclaimers

The Beehive is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we make no warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Beehive will be uninterrupted or error-free.

Certain jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties. In those jurisdictions, some disclaimers may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights under local laws.

Chunky Tofu Studios is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The Beehive app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, as it could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features, and it could mean that the Beehive app won’t work properly or at all.

Chunky Tofu Studios cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi or data. If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Chunky Tofu Studios cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Chunky Tofu Studios cannot accept responsibility.

Although we endeavor to ensure that the app is updated and correct at all times, we rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Chunky Tofu Studios accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android and iOS – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Chunky Tofu Studios does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Chunky Tofu shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your use of the Beehive.

In some jurisdictions, limitations of liability are not permitted. If so, the limitations in these Terms may not apply to you.

## Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold Chunky Tofu harmless from any claims, losses, or expenses arising from your breach of these Terms or misuse of the Beehive.

## Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction Country], excluding its conflict of law rules. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of [Jurisdiction Country] unless applicable law provides you additional rights or requires disputes to be handled differently.

If you reside in a country with mandatory consumer protection laws, you may also benefit from those local protections, and these Terms do not override your non-waivable rights.

## Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes, and your continued use of the Beehive means you accept the updated Terms.
